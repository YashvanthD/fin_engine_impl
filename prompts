now lets go to pond so there actually adding fish and events will make some data
user will open our web site
if ponds are already created then
user will chose sampling means
user go to those ponds
which do select the pond to add fish
and he get the fish dropdown there we will be listed all the fish entities (already in the database if not he have api to create)
now he choose pond
he choose which fish he will going to add
he choose some random n fish to add (say for 10) he take a test on it weight age color and fish specification after taking n fish samples form the bunch
he add those m count of fish to the pond
now we will store the data based on the account_key
fish_mapping (it means this says which are the fishes in the form)
fish_activity (it says which fish when added how it was and all those info)
pond_events (it says which pod when it got fishes how many what is the pond current stats all those )
so now after seeing all these requirement update the pond api properly
